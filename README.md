# ng-camera

Ng-camera is an AngularJS directive for capturing images
form your computer's camera, and delivering them to you as [Data URIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme).
The images is transmitted to your AngularJS controller and can be modified
like you want.

To manage this process, ng-camera uses the [WebcamJS](https://github.com/jhuckaby/webcamjs) standalone Javascript library developed by Joseph Huckaby,
to ensure fallback and crossbrowser requirements.

## Live example

To see a live example, go to the [demo's page](http://bcabanes.github.io/ng-camera).

## Installation

#### Using [Bower](http://bower.io/)

```bash
bower install ng-camera
```

## Usage

### Import files scripts

Ng-camera uses WebcamJS to work properly so you need to add the script in your
main file, don't forget to load the directive file:

```html
<script src="/path/to/webcam.js"></script>
<script src="/path/to/ng-camera.js"></script>
```

### Add the module as dependency

Simply add the module as dependency to your main application module like this:
```javascript
angular.module('myApplication', ['camera']);
```

### The directive

```html
<ng-camera
    capture-message="Cheeeese!"
    countdown="3"
    output-height="160"
    output-width="213"
    viewer-height="320"
    viewer-width="426"
    crop-height="90"
    crop-width="120"
    image-format="jpeg"
    jpeg-quality="100"

    flash-fallback-url="/vendors/webcamjs/webcam.swf"
    overlay-url="/overlay.png"
    shutter-url="/shutter.mp3"
